# Hydrogen storage in Ti-Fe-Hf alloys
## Step 1
Bjorn: I performed the convergence tests, I worked on my local cluster provided by the university of antwerp, I tried running it first on my own virtual machine but this took literal hours, so I switched to the hpc.
The convergence tests resulted in the following parameters for the TiFe crystal cif file: k = 11 11 11, ecutwfc = 124 and ecutrho = 1736 (=14 * 124). Running the calculation this way took about 40 seconds on the cluster. The resulting hydrostatic pressure was 31.33 kbar.
